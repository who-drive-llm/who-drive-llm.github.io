      <p>
      As LLMs reshape the computing landscape, the HCI community is rapidly embracing this trend. However, who leads this wave and how it impacts CHI remain unclear. We address this gap by analyzing 8,322 CHI papers (2015-2025), focusing on 441 LLM publications since 2020. Our analysis of 396 first authors reveals a diverse mix of HCI researchers (36.9%), newcomers (30.3%), and researchers from other fields (22.2%). Notably, these backgrounds correlate with distinct citation patterns. Collaboration is shifting from intra- to multi-institutional and international networks, a trend especially pronounced in LLM research. The US, China, and South Korea are key contributors. We also found a significant thematic imbalance, with over 80% of studies focusing on LLMs as system engines or for understanding user perception. This study presents the first large-scale characterization of the LLM research at CHI, exposing both adaptability and imbalance, and releases an open dataset to support future work.
